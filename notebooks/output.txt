IME 431 - Process Integration with SAP ERP 

Credits: 3 
 
This online course provides an overview of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP systems), which 
provide means for the holistic, real-time integration of the key business processes (e.g. materials 
management, production planning and control, quality management, transportation and logistics, 
warehouse management, and sales and distribution) of manufacturing companies. Students learn how ERP 
systems facilitate process integration using the SAP ERP software and production data from a fictitious 
company that manufacturers bikes. To assure learning, students are required to work, using the SAP ERP 
software, on a variety of hands-on exercises related to the fictitious bike manufacturer in which they create 
transactions (e.g. generate a production or purchase order or execute a production plan) that generate an 
effective and timely flow of information and transactional data across the involved functional areas of the 
company, which enables the real-time integration of business processes. With the idea of enhancing 
learning, some of the hands-on exercises involve the company's Material Requirements Planning (MRP) and 
Master Production Scheduling System (MPS) systems. Instructional materials, including the SAP ERP 
software, and multiple learning activities allow students to: 1) Learn about the fundamentals, importance, 
and benefits of the holistic integration of business processes using enterprise software, 2) Understand the 
principles and logic of operation of ERP systems, and 3) Develop an appreciation of the capabilities and 

functionality of the application modules of the SAP ERP software.
