    "Welcome to a use of TensorFlow, TensorFlow Model Hub, and Google's Universal Sentence Encode to perform feature extraction on the University of Southern Indiana's 2022-2023 description of all courses. To do our work requires some basic NLP text parsing skills to create a dataset, and from there we can obtain our embeddings (aka feature vectors). After creating embeddings (aka feature vectors) of all descriptions we will create a Hierarchical Navigable Small World graph of our embeddings to query our vectors for the most similar vector using cosine similarity.\n",
